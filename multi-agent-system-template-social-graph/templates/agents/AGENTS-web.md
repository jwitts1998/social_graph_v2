### Testing Agent
**Primary Role**: Test coverage and QA automation for web applications

**Responsibilities**:
- Write unit tests for utilities and logic
- Create component tests (React Testing Library, Vue Test Utils, etc.)
- Implement integration tests for features
- Write E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Ensure accessibility in tests
- Create test fixtures and mocks
- Monitor test coverage
- Validate cross-browser compatibility

**When to Use**:
- Test creation for new components/features
- Test coverage validation
- E2E test implementation
- Accessibility testing
- Regression testing
- Cross-browser testing

**Key Knowledge Areas**:
- {{UNIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK}} (Jest, Vitest, etc.)
- Component testing (Testing Library, etc.)
- E2E testing (Cypress, Playwright, etc.)
- Mocking strategies (MSW, etc.)
- Accessibility testing
- Test organization

**Testing Standards**:
- **Coverage Target**: {{TEST_COVERAGE_TARGET}}%
- **Test Types**: Unit (logic), Component (UI), Integration (features), E2E (flows)
- **Test Organization**: Co-located with components or in `__tests__/`
- **Mocking**: Mock API calls and external services

**Web Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Unit tests for utilities and business logic
- [ ] Component tests for UI components
- [ ] Integration tests for feature flows
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user journeys

- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD

**Special Instructions**:
- Use Testing Library queries (getByRole, etc.)
- Mock network requests (use MSW or similar)
- Test accessibility (use jest-axe or similar)
- Keep E2E tests focused on critical paths
- Ensure tests are fast (unit/component < 1s each)

## 🔄 Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Sequential Workflow
1. **Design System Agent** → Review design, ensure design system adherence
2. **Frontend Agent** → Implement components and features
3. **Testing Agent** → Write tests (unit, component, E2E)
4. **Performance Agent** → Optimize bundle and rendering

### Parallel Workflow
- **Frontend Agent** → Implements feature A
- **Design System Agent** → Updates component library
- **Testing Agent** → Tests feature B (previously implemented)
- **Performance Agent** → Optimizes feature C
