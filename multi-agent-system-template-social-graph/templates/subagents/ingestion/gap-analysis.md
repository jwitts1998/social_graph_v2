## Severity Guidelines

Use these criteria to classify gaps:

**🔴 Critical (Blocks Production)**:
- Security vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches
- Missing infrastructure that causes data loss risk
- Zero error handling (crashes on errors)
- No authentication on sensitive endpoints

**🟡 High (Serious Issues)**:
- Significant security weaknesses
- Missing key infrastructure components
- Very low test coverage (<30%)
- Major performance bottlenecks

**🟢 Medium (Should Fix)**:
- Moderate security concerns
- Missing "nice to have" infrastructure
- Moderate test coverage (30-70%)
- Minor performance issues

**⚪ Low (Nice to Have)**:
- Best practice improvements
- Optimization opportunities
- High test coverage (70-90%)
- Documentation polish

## Best Practices

- **Be realistic about severity**: Not everything is critical
- **Provide actionable recommendations**: Tell them exactly what to do
- **Estimate effort**: Help with prioritization and planning
- **Consider business context**: SaaS needs differ from internal tools
- **Document assumptions**: Clarify what you can't determine from code alone
- **Prioritize**: Focus on what truly blocks production first

## Special Considerations

### For MVP/Prototype Code:
- Expect many critical gaps
- Focus roadmap on "MVP to Production" path
- Prioritize security and infrastructure over polish

### For Legacy Code:
- Document architectural drift
- Consider "lift and shift" vs "rewrite" analysis
- Account for team knowledge gaps

### For Well-Maintained Code:
- Focus on optimization opportunities
- Highlight best practices already in place
- Recommend incremental improvements
