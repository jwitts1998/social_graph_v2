## Success Metrics to Highlight

### Current Baseline (Before)
- Match quality: 65% positive feedback
- Engagement: 40% act on suggestions
- Time to intro: 5 days average
- User trust: 6.5/10

### Targets (After, 90 days)
- Match quality: 85%+ positive feedback (**+30%**)
- Engagement: 65%+ act on suggestions (**+62%**)
- Time to intro: 2-3 days average (**-50%**)
- User trust: 8.5/10 (**+30%**)

### ROI Calculation
```
Time Savings:
  Before: 16 hours/week per user
  After: 5 hours/week per user
  Savings: 11 hours/week = 44 hours/month
  
Value: 44 hours × $150/hour = $6,600/user/month

50 users: $330,000/month = $3.96M/year

Costs: $200/month (API) + 10 hours maintenance
Total: ~$2,000/month = $24K/year

Net ROI: $3.936M/year
ROI Percentage: 16,400%
```
